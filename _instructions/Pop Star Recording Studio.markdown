description: Get ready to lay down some new tracks! Help Olivia get all the technical equipment in the production room ready for Livi the pop star to come in and record her next big hit album. Now it’s time to head into the recording booth to test out all the settings. Put Olivia’s headset on then grab the guitar, step up to the microphone and have fun recording a demo. At the end of the song, press the button to eject the CD and have a rest on the sofa with a drink and a magazine. You are all set for a great hit! Includes Olivia mini-doll figure.
