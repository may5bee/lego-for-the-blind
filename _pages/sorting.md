Though the following sorting instructions and tips are pretty obvious to the average sighted person, I'm putting them here, just in case.
</p>
<p>
In most larger sets, the plastic bags with the pieces in them will be numbered. Each bag has sub-bags, e.g Bag 1 has six sub-bags. Take a lot of Tupperware containers or bowls, and dump out all the pieces from bag 1. Then sort them by color. The smallest pieces come in a separate sub-bag of bag 1, so don't mix them with the other pieces. 
</p>
<p>
Then take a bunch of Ziploc bags, a permanent marker, Lego's graphical instructions, and the textual instructions, (make sure that the pieces you are putting into a ziploc are the same in the graphical and text-based instructions), and then sort the pieces according to Lego's instructions. Take another ziploc and label it Extras. Put all the pieces you end up with at the end of the sorting process into this bag, and trust me, you'll have some extras, with no idea as to where they came from. 
</p>
<p>
Sorting Lego is like taking apart a watch, you'll always end up with extras, but don't worry, they'll find their place during the building process. Next, if the same type of piece comes up in different colors, e.g 1 blue 1x2 amongst grey 1x2s, then put the blue 1x2 into a separate bag, which you should put inside ziploc 1. 
</p>
<p>
Check with the text-based instructions to make sure you are sorting according to their specifications as well as Lego's. Make sure not to overstuff a ziploc, put 5-20 pieces, per bag; more than that will be unwieldy. If you have 1x1 flat-smooth pieces, in blue, and green, as well as other pieces which are needed for construction of a step, label one bag, A, and the other bag b, put the pieces into a and b as the graphical and text instructions dictate, and put them inside of Bag 1. After you've sorted about 20 bags, put them into a large Ziploc bag, and label it Large Bag 1. It's easier for a blind person to rifle through 20 bags, rather than 50 to find the bag they need. Sometimes the point at which to start a large bag, isn't the same as in Lego's instructions, but that's fine.
</p>
<p>Continue sorting until all of the pieces have found a home. Then present the set to your builder and let the building begin!

<!-- 
The text-based instructions are so complicated that it can be difficult for a sighted person to comprehend them. Try to figure out something like this sequence from Book 1 of the Lego Tower Bridge Set, No. 10214:

Key: F = flat.
FS = flat smooth.
Hor = horizontally.
Ver = vertically.
Symm = symmetrically.
PP = previous piece.

Number 1

Step 1. Put a F 32x16 hor on the table. It is blue and symbolizes the Thames.

Step 2. Put a 6x1 with side holes ver on the left edge, in the middle (skipping the front five rows).

Step 3. Repeat symm on the right.

Number 2

Step 1. Put a FS 4x2 hor to the left of the PP, in the middle (on the 8th and 9th rows).

Step 2. Put a 2x1 slide ver to the left, slide to the right.

Step 3. Repeat Steps 1-2 symm on the left.

Later sets were easier for Lilya; she realized that she could just type the instructions on the computer and e-mail them to me, and  my screen-reader took care of the rest, so there was no need to braille anything. Sometimes though, there were difficulties. Sometimes Lilya made a mistake. More often I claimed she had made a mistake and then realized that I had misread her instructions. Some structures were so shaky that I needed another pair of hands to steady them until sections were connected ten steps later. For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to build a 1930s General Electric refrigerator. My only consolation was that the friend who finally put it together works as a watchmaker for Rolex--and it took him forty minutes!

  Now, having described over twenty LEGO sets, our jargon is clear and concise. The terms we use are similar to the piece names originally chosen by the LEGO Group. The instructions have grown shorter, and my fingers have grown more nimble.  -->

Currently I have accessible instructions for the following LEGO sets (set numbers are in parentheses):

{% for instructions in site.instructions %}
- [{{instructions.title}} ({{instructions.setnumber}})]({{instructions.url}})
{% endfor %}
